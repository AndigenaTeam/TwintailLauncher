            Supported games
             - Genshin Impact
             - Honkai: Star Rail
             - Honkai Impact 3rd

            Is this safe to use? Can I get banned?
            We do our best to ensure the launcher avoids detection and doesn't interfere with sensitive files or anti-cheat systems. However, some games require the Launcher to disable the anti-cheat to get them running (Linux only). So use TTL at your own risk
